# Sample Resource for FiveM C# Scripting

This resource was straight up generated with the C# Project Generator found in the [Documentation](https://docs.fivem.net/docs/scripting-manual/runtimes/csharp/) with a few tweaks to make it easier for you to understand.

To edit it, either open `MyResource.sln` in Visual Studio or open the whole folder in Visual Studio Code.

To build it, run `build.cmd`.

Then you can take the .dll files and the fxmanifest, create a resource and throw it into your server.

If you truly want to learn how to script in C#, I **Strongly** Recommend a Video Tutorial. Here's the first one I found on youtube: https://youtu.be/J5VejWhYf7E
